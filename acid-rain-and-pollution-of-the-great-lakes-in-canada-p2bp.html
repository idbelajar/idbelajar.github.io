                    <p>Acid rain can severely damage both plant and animal life. Certain lakes, for example,have lost all fish and plant life because of acid rain. Acid rain comes from sulfur in coal and oil.When they burn, they make sulfur dioxide (S02 ). Most sulfur leaves factory chimneys as thegaseous sulfur dioxide (SO2 ) and most nitrogen are also emitted as one of the nitrogen oxides(NO or NO2), both of which are gasses. The gasses may be dry deposited absorbed directly bythe land, by lakes or by the surface vegetation. If they are in the atmosphere at any time, thegasses will oxidize (gain an oxygen atom) and go into solution as acids. Sulphuric acid (H2 SO4) and the nitrogen oxides will become nitric acid (HNO3 ). The acids usually dissolve in clouddroplets and may travel great distances before being precipitated as acid rain. Catalysts such ashydrogen peroxide, ozone, and ammonium help promote the formation of acids in clouds. Moreammonium (NH4 ) can be formed when some of the acids are partially neutralized by airborneammonia (NH3). Acidification increases with the number of active hydrogen (H+) ionsdissolved in acid. Hydrocarbons emitted by, for example, car exhausts will react in sunlight withnitrogen oxides to produce ozone. Although it is invaluable in the atmosphere, low-level ozonecauses respiratory problems and also hastens the formation of acid rain. When acid rain falls onthe ground it dissolves and liberates heavy metals and aluminum (Al). When it is washed intolakes, aluminum irritates the outer surfaces of many fish. As acid rain falls or drains into the lakethe pH of the lake falls. Forests suffer the effect of acid rain through damage to leaves, throughthe loss of vital nutrients, and through the increased amounts of toxic metals liberated by acid,which damage roots and soil microorganisms.41.

                                            acid rain is a kind of air pollution . when coal ,oil ,or gasoline are burned they release harmful gasesinto the air. theses gases mix with the moisture that is love present in the air and form weak acids. wind can carry the acidid droplets huge distances .eventually , these droplets return to the ground as acid rain or as acid hail , snow, sleet or even fog.
acid rain looks, feels, and tastes just like clean rain . for the humans walking in acid , or even swimming in a lake polluted by acid rain ,is no more dangerous than walking or swimming in clean water but acid rain is extremely harmful to the environment.
when acid rain gets into lakes and streams . it kills the fish and other animals and plants that live there. many rivers in scandinavia no longer have any fish .all the fish have been killed by acid rain.
the outside surfaces of stone buildings and monuments can also be corroded or worn away,by acid rain.some of the world's greatest buildings and monuments show signs of damage caused by acid rain. acid rain eats away at the steel in bridges and railings as well.

                                            Acid rain is a kind of air pollution. When coal, oil, or gasoline are burned, they release harmful gases into the air. These gases mix with the moisture that is always present in the air and form weak acids. Wind can carry the acidic droplets huge distances. Eventually, these droplets return to the ground as acid rain or as acid hail snow, sleet, or even fog. Acid rain looks, feels, and tastes just like clean rain. For humans, walking in acid rain, or even swimming in a lake polluted by acid rain, is no more dangerous than walking or swimming in clean water. But acid rain is extremely harmful to the environment When acid rain gets into lakes and streams, it kills the fish and other animals and plants that live there. Many rivers in Scandinavia no longer have any fish. All the fish have been killed by acid rain. The outside surfaces of stone buildings and monuments can also be corroded, or wom away, by acid rain. Some of the world's greatest buildings and monuments show signs of damage caused by acid rain. Acid rain eats away at the steel in bridges and railings as well.

                                            Acid Rain
Acid rain is rain that is highly acidic because of sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and other air pollutants dissolve in it. Normal rain is slightly acidic, with a pH od 6. Acid rain may have a pH value as low as 2.8.
Acid rain can severely damage both plant and animal life. Certain lakes for example, have lost all fish and plant life because of acid rain.
Acid rain comes from sulphur in coal and oil. When they burn, they make sulphur dioxide (SO2). Most sulphur leave factory chimney as the gaseous sulphur dioxide (SO2) and most nitrogen is also emitted as one of the nitrogen oxides (NO or NO2), both of which are gases. The gases may be dry deposited-absorbed directly by the land, by lakes, or by the surface vegetation. If they are in the atmosphere for any time, the gas will oxidise (gain an oxygen atom) an go into solution as acids.
Sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and the nitrogen oxides will become nitric acid (HNO3). The acids usually dissolve in cloud droplets and may travel great distance before being precipitated as acid rain. Catalysts such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone and ammonium help promote the formation of acids in clouds. More ammonium (NH4) can be formed when some of the acids are partially neutralized airborne ammonia (NH3). Acidification increases with the number of active hydrogen (H+) ions dissolve in acid. Hydrocarbons emitted by for example car exhaust will react in sunlight with nitrogen oxides to produce ozone. Although it is invaluable in the atmosphere, low level ozone causes respiratory problems and hastens the formation of acid rain. When acids rain falls on the ground it dissolved and liberates heavy metals and aluminium (Al). when it is washed into lakes, aluminium irritates the outer surface of many fish. As acid rain falls or drains into the lake the pH of the lakes falls. Forest suffer the effect of acid rain through damage to leaves, through the lost of vital nutrients and through the increased amount of toxic metals liberated by acid, which damage roots and soil microorganism.

Acid rain is rain that is highly acidic because of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and other air pollutants dissolved in it. Normal rain is slightly acidic, with a pH of 6. Acid rain may have a pH value as low as 2.8.
Acid rain can severely damage both plant and animal life. Certain lakes, for example, have lost all fish and plant life because of acid rain.
Acid rain comes from sulfur in coal and oil. When they burn, they make sulfur dioxide (SO2). Most sulfur leaves factory chimneys as the gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO2) and most nitrogen are also emitted as one of the nitrogen oxides (NO or NO2), both of which are gasses. The gasses may be dry deposited–absorbed directly by the land, by lakes or by the surface vegetation. If they are in the atmosphere for anytime, the gasses will oxidize (gain an oxygen atom) and go into solution as acids. Sulphuric acid (H2 SO4) and the nitrogen oxides will become nitric acid (HNO3). The acids usually dissolve in cloud droplets and may travel great distances before being precipitated as acid rain.
Catalysts such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and ammonium help promote the formation of acids in clouds. More ammonium (NH4) can be formed when some of the acids are partially neutralized by airborne ammonia (NH3). Acidification increases with the number of active hydrogen (H+) ions dissolved in acid. Hydrocarbons emitted by, for example, car exhausts will react in sunlight with nitrogen oxides to produce ozone. Although it is invaluable in the atmosphere, low-level ozone causes respiratory problems and also hastens the formation of acid rain. When acid rain falls on the ground it dissolves and liberates heavy metals and aluminum (Al). When it is washed into lakes, aluminum irritates the outer surfaces of many fish. As acid rain falls or drains into the lake the pH of the lake falls. Forests suffer the effect of acid rain through damage to leaves, through the loss of vital nutrients, and through the increased amounts of toxic metals liberated by acid, which damage roots and soil microorganisms.

                            4. Acid Rain
Acid rain is rain that is highly acidic because of sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and other air pollutants dissolve in it. Normal rain is slightly acidic, with a pH od 6. Acid rain may have a pH value as low as 2.8.
Acid rain can severely damage both plant and animal life. Certain lakes for example, have lost all fish and plant life because of acid rain.
Acid rain comes from sulphur in coal and oil. When they burn, they make sulphur dioxide (SO2). Most sulphur leave factory chimney as the gaseous sulphur dioxide (SO2) and most nitrogen is also emitted as one of the nitrogen oxides (NO or NO2), both of which are gases. The gases may be dry deposited-absorbed directly by the land, by lakes, or by the surface vegetation. If they are in the atmosphere for any time, the gas will oxidise (gain an oxygen atom) an go into solution as acids.
Sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and the nitrogen oxides will become nitric acid (HNO3). The acids usually dissolve in cloud droplets and may travel great distance before being precipitated as acid rain. Catalysts such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone and ammonium help promote the formation of acids in clouds. More ammonium (NH4) can be formed when some of the acids are partially neutralized airborne ammonia (NH3). Acidification increases with the number of active hydrogen (H+) ions dissolve in acid. Hydrocarbons emitted by for example car exhaust will react in sunlight with nitrogen oxides to produce ozone. Although it is invaluable in the atmosphere, low level ozone causes respiratory problems and hastens the formation of acid rain. When acids rain falls on the ground it dissolved and liberates heavy metals and aluminium (Al). when it is washed into lakes, aluminium irritates the outer surface of many fish. As acid rain falls or drains into the lake the pH of the lakes falls. Forest suffer the effect of acid rain through damage to leaves, through the lost of vital nutrients and through the increased amount of toxic metals liberated by acid, which damage roots and soil microorganism.
the gases may be drying deposited absorbed directly by the land,by lakes or by the surface "vegetation"

                            5. acid rain is a kind of air pollution . when coal ,oil ,or gasoline are burned they release harmful gasesinto the air. theses gases mix with the moisture that is love present in the air and form weak acids. wind can carry the acidid droplets huge distances .eventually , these droplets return to the ground as acid rain or as acid hail , snow, sleet or even fog.
acid rain looks, feels, and tastes just like clean rain . for the humans walking in acid , or even swimming in a lake polluted by acid rain ,is no more dangerous than walking or swimming in clean water but acid rain is extremely harmful to the environment.
when acid rain gets into lakes and streams . it kills the fish and other animals and plants that live there. many rivers in scandinavia no longer have any fish .all the fish have been killed by acid rain.
the outside surfaces of stone buildings and monuments can also be corroded or worn away,by acid rain.some of the world's greatest buildings and monuments show signs of damage caused by acid rain. acid rain eats away at the steel in bridges and railings as well.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p>The text mainly discusses the effects of acid rain on the environment, including its impact on plant and animal life, as well as the causes of acid rain, which are primarily from sulfur in coal and oil.The acid of normal rain is about 5.6 pH, then the acid rain has a value as low as 2.8.When coal and oil burn, they produce sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NO or NO2), which are gases that can contribute to acid rain.The sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides will be oxidized and converted into acid when they are in the atmosphere.The purpose of the text is to inform the reader about the negative effects of acid rain on the environment and the causes of acid rain. It also discusses how acid rain can damage plant and animal life and the process of acid rain formation.<br />

                            14. Acid Rain
Acid rain is rain that is highly acidic because of sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and other air pollutants dissolve in it. Normal rain is slightly acidic, with a pH od 6. Acid rain may have a pH value as low as 2.8.
Acid rain can severely damage both plant and animal life. Certain lakes for example, have lost all fish and plant life because of acid rain.
Acid rain comes from sulphur in coal and oil. When they burn, they make sulphur dioxide (SO2). Most sulphur leave factory chimney as the gaseous sulphur dioxide (SO2) and most nitrogen is also emitted as one of the nitrogen oxides (NO or NO2), both of which are gases. The gases may be dry deposited-absorbed directly by the land, by lakes, or by the surface vegetation. If they are in the atmosphere for any time, the gas will oxidise (gain an oxygen atom) an go into solution as acids.
Sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and the nitrogen oxides will become nitric acid (HNO3). The acids usually dissolve in cloud droplets and may travel great distance before being precipitated as acid rain. Catalysts such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone and ammonium help promote the formation of acids in clouds. More ammonium (NH4) can be formed when some of the acids are partially neutralized airborne ammonia (NH3). Acidification increases with the number of active hydrogen (H+) ions dissolve in acid. Hydrocarbons emitted by for example car exhaust will react in sunlight with nitrogen oxides to produce ozone. Although it is invaluable in the atmosphere, low level ozone causes respiratory problems and hastens the formation of acid rain. When acids rain falls on the ground it dissolved and liberates heavy metals and aluminium (Al). when it is washed into lakes, aluminium irritates the outer surface of many fish. As acid rain falls or drains into the lake the pH of the lakes falls. Forest suffer the effect of acid rain through damage to leaves, through the lost of vital nutrients and through the increased amount of toxic metals liberated by acid, which damage roots and soil microorganism.
the gases may be drying deposited absorbed directly by the land,by lakes or by the surface "vegetation"
