                                            In 776 B.C, the first Olympic Games were held at the foot of Mount Olympus to honor the Greeks’ chief god, Zeus. The Greeks emphasized physical fitness and strength in their education of youth. Therefore, contests in running, jumping, discus and javelin throwing, boxing, and horse and chariot racing were held in individual cities, and the winners competed every four years at Mount Olympus. Winners were greatly honored by having olive wreaths placed on their heads and having poems sung about their deeds. Originally these were held at games of friendship, and any wars in progress were halted to allow the games to take place.
The Greeks attached so much importance to these games that they calculated time in four-year cycles called "Olympiads" dating from 776 B.C.
Why were the Olympic Games held?
A. To stop wars.
B. To honor Zeus.
C. To crown the best athletes.
D. To sing songs about the athletes.
E. To educate young people.</a>

                            15. In 776 B.C, the first Olympic Games were held at the foot of Mount Olympus to honor the Greeks’ chief god, Zeus. The Greeks emphasized physical fitness and strength in their education of youth. Therefore, contests in running, jumping, discus and javelin throwing, boxing, and horse and chariot racing were held in individual cities, and the winners competed every four years at Mount Olympus. Winners were greatly honored by having olive wreaths placed on their heads and having poems sung about their deeds. Originally these were held at games of friendship, and any wars in progress were halted to allow the games to take place.
The Greeks attached so much importance to these games that they calculated time in four-year cycles called "Olympiads" dating from 776 B.C.
Which of the following is not true?
A. Winners placed olive wreaths on their own heads.
B. The games were held in Greece every four years.
C. Battles were interrupted to participate in the games.
D. Poems glorified the winners in song.
E. The games were conducted as games of friendship.</h2><br />
