                                            there lived two families, the Capulets and the Montagues.They engaged in a bitter feud. Among the Montagues was Romeo, a hot-blooded young man with an eye for the ladies. One day, Romeo attended the feast of the Capulets’, a costume party where he expected to meethis love, Rosaline, a haughty beauty from a well-to-do family.Once there, however, Romeo’s eyes felt upon Juliet, and he thought of Rosaline no more.
The vision of Juliet had been invading his every thought. Unable to sleep, Romeo returned late that night to the Juliet’s bedroom window. There, he was surprised to find Juliet on the balcony, professing her love for him and wishing that he were not a “Montague”, a name behind his own. “What’s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.” Romeo was ready to deny his nameand professed his love. The two agreed to meet at nine o-clock the next morning to be married.
Early the next morning, Romeo came to Friar Lawrence begging the friar to marry him to Juliet. The Friar performed theceremony, praying that the union might someday put an end to the feud between the two families. He advised Romeo kept the marriage asecretfor a time.
On the way home, Romeo chanced upon hisfriend Mercutio arguing with Tybalt, a member of the Capulet clan. That qurreling last caused Merquito died.Romeowas reluctant no longer. He drew his sword and slew Tybalt died. Romeo realized he had made a terrible mistake.Then Friar Lawrence advised Romeo to travel to Mantua until things cool down. He promised to inform Juliet.
on the other hand, Juliet’s father had decided the time for her to marry with Paris. Juliet consulted Friar Lawrence and made a plot to take a sleeping potion for Juliet which would simulate death for three days. The plot proceeded according to the plan. Juliet was sleeping in death.
Unfortunately, The Friar’s letter failed to reach Romeo. Under the cover of darkness, he broke into Juliet’s tomb. Romeo kissed the lips of his Juliet one last time and drankthe poison. Meanwhile, the effects of the sleeping potion wear off.Juliet woke up calling for Romeo. She found her love next to her but was lying dead, with a cup of poison in his hand. She tried to kiss the poison from his lips, but failed. Then Juliet put out his dagger and plunged it into her breast. She died.

                                            The story of Romeo and Juliet takes place in Verona in Italy. Two families, the Montagues and the Capulets, hate each other so much that they fight on the street whenever they meet. One of these families, the Capulets, organizes a big party so that they can introduce their daughter Juliet to a rich nobleman, Count Paris, who has asked to marry her. Juliet is nearly 14, and her parents are keen for her to marry soon. Romeo is the son of the Montague family, and is also about 14. Romeo and his friends decide that it would be exciting to go to the Capulets’ party too. But they agree that they must go in disguise because if they are recognized at the party by the Capulets, they might be killed. That night, at the party, Romeo meets Juliet, and they fall in love at first sight. However, Juliet’s cousin, Tybalt, recognizes Romeo, knows he is from the Montague family – and wants to kill him. Romeo hides in the garden, and talks to Juliet when she appears on her balcony. They realize that they are perfect for each other, and decide to get married. The next day, they go to a priest called Friar Lawrence, who marries them in secret. Juliet’s cousin, Tybalt, gets angry very easily. He starts a fight with Romeo’s best friend. When Romeo steps in to break up the fight between the two men, his best friend is accidentally killed. Romeo runs after Tybalt in anger and kills him. Then, Romeo is sent away from Verona. Meanwhile, the Capulets decide that Juliet must marry Count Paris immediately. When Juliet says that she doesn’t want to, her parents are very angry with her, and her mother says she will never speak to her again. Of course, they do not know that she has already secretly married Romeo. Juliet asks FriarLawrence to get her out of this difficult situation, so that she can see her beloved Romeo again. Friar Lawrence has an idea – he gives Juliet a drug which will make everyone think that she is dead, when in fact she’s only in a long, deep sleep. While Juliet is sleeping, Friar Lawrence sends a message to Romeo to tell him to come to her tomb and take her away. When the guests arrive for Juliet’s wedding the next day, Juliet’s lifeless body is discovered. Believing she is dead, her family put her in their tomb.

There, inside the tomb, he meets Count Paris, who has also come to say goodbye to Juliet. The two fight and Romeo kills him.

They got married with the help of a priest, Friar Laurence, and Juliet's maid. Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, hated Romeo and the Montagues. One day he met Romeo and his friend Mercutio in the street. They had a sword fight and Mercutio was killed. Romeo was so upset that he attacked and killed Tybalt in revenge. As a result of this, Romeo had to leave Verona to save his life. He visited Juliet secretly that night and then left for Mantua. Juliet's parents wanted Juliet to marry Paris, a friend of the family. They arranged the marriage and Juliet was horrified. She asked Friar Laurence to help her. He suggested a plan:he gave her a drug to make her sleep for a long time and appear dead to everyone else. When Juliet woke up, she could join Romeo in Mantua. Friar Laurence promised to write to Romeo and explain the plan. The night before the wedding, Juliet took the drug and her family found her dead in the morning. The celebration turned into a funeral. Unfortunately, Romeo never received the letter from Friar Laurence. He returned to Verona where he found Juliet's body. He thought she was dead and was so devastated that he killed himself.

One day, Romeo attended the feast of the Capulets’, a costume party where he expected to meethis love, Rosaline, a haughty beauty from a well-to-do family.Once there, however, Romeo’s eyes felt upon Juliet, and he thought of Rosaline no more.
The vision of Juliet had been invading his every thought. Unable to sleep, Romeo returned late that night to the Juliet’s bedroom window. There, he was surprised to find Juliet on the balcony, professing her love for him and wishing that he were not a “Montague”, a name behind his own. “What’s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.” Romeo was ready to deny his nameand professed his love. The two agreed to meet at nine o-clock the next morning to be married.
Early the next morning, Romeo came to Friar Lawrence begging the friar to marry him to Juliet. The Friar performed theceremony, praying that the union might someday put an end to the feud between the two families. He advised Romeo kept the marriage asecretfor a time.
On the way home, Romeo chanced upon hisfriend Mercutio arguing with Tybalt, a member of the Capulet clan. That qurreling last caused Merquito died.Romeowas reluctant no longer. He drew his sword and slew Tybalt died. Romeo realized he had made a terrible mistake.Then Friar Lawrence advised Romeo to travel to Mantua until things cool down. He promised to inform Juliet.
on the other hand, Juliet’s father had decided the time for her to marry with Paris. Juliet consulted Friar Lawrence and made a plot to take a sleeping potion for Juliet which would simulate death for three days. The plot proceeded according to the plan. Juliet was sleeping in death.
Unfortunately, The Friar’s letter failed to reach Romeo. Under the cover of darkness, he broke into Juliet’s tomb. Romeo kissed the lips of his Juliet one last time and drankthe poison. Meanwhile, the effects of the sleeping potion wear off.Juliet woke up calling for Romeo. She found her love next to her but was lying dead, with a cup of poison in his hand. She tried to kiss the poison from his lips, but failed. Then Juliet put out his dagger and plunged it into her breast. She died.

                            10. The story of Romeo and Juliet takes place in Verona in Italy. Two families, the Montagues and the Capulets, hate each other so much that they fight on the street whenever they meet. One of these families, the Capulets, organizes a big party so that they can introduce their daughter Juliet to a rich nobleman, Count Paris, who has asked to marry her. Juliet is nearly 14, and her parents are keen for her to marry soon. Romeo is the son of the Montague family, and is also about 14. Romeo and his friends decide that it would be exciting to go to the Capulets’ party too. But they agree that they must go in disguise because if they are recognized at the party by the Capulets, they might be killed. That night, at the party, Romeo meets Juliet, and they fall in love at first sight. However, Juliet’s cousin, Tybalt, recognizes Romeo, knows he is from the Montague family – and wants to kill him. Romeo hides in the garden, and talks to Juliet when she appears on her balcony. They realize that they are perfect for each other, and decide to get married. The next day, they go to a priest called Friar Lawrence, who marries them in secret. Juliet’s cousin, Tybalt, gets angry very easily. He starts a fight with Romeo’s best friend. When Romeo steps in to break up the fight between the two men, his best friend is accidentally killed. Romeo runs after Tybalt in anger and kills him. Then, Romeo is sent away from Verona. Meanwhile, the Capulets decide that Juliet must marry Count Paris immediately. When Juliet says that she doesn’t want to, her parents are very angry with her, and her mother says she will never speak to her again. Of course, they do not know that she has already secretly married Romeo. Juliet asks FriarLawrence to get her out of this difficult situation, so that she can see her beloved Romeo again. Friar Lawrence has an idea – he gives Juliet a drug which will make everyone think that she is dead, when in fact she’s only in a long, deep sleep. While Juliet is sleeping, Friar Lawrence sends a message to Romeo to tell him to come to her tomb and take her away. When the guests arrive for Juliet’s wedding the next day, Juliet’s lifeless body is discovered. Believing she is dead, her family put her in their tomb. Tragically, Romeo never gets Friar Lawrence’s message that Juliet has taken a drug and is really alive, he only hears that she is dead. Romeo returns to Verona, and goes to Juliet’s tomb. There, inside the tomb, he meets Count Paris, who has also come to say goodbye to Juliet. The two fight and Romeo kills him. Romeo still believes that Juliet is dead, so he drinks poison and dies, but soon after this, Juliet’s drug stops working and she wakes up. She sees that Romeo is dead, takes his knife, and kills herself too. When the Capulets and Montagues discover both their children dead, they are united in their sadness. The two families decide to make peace with each other, and promise to build a monument to the memory of both Romeo and Juliet.Do the questions below!1.

ROMEO and JULIET 
Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet lived in Verona. They met at a party and it was love at first sight. Their families were enemies so the young couple could not meet in the open. They got married with the help of a priest, Friar Laurence, and Juliet's maid. Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, hated Romeo and the Montagues. One day he met Romeo and his friend Mercutio in the street. They had a sword fight and Mercutio was killed. Romeo was so upset that he attacked and killed Tybalt in revenge. As a result of this, Romeo had to leave Verona to save his life. He visited Juliet secretly that night and then left for Mantua. Juliet's parents wanted Juliet to marry Paris, a friend of the family. They arranged the marriage and Juliet was horrified. She asked Friar Laurence to help her. He suggested a plan:he gave her a drug to make her sleep for a long time and appear dead to everyone else. When Juliet woke up, she could join Romeo in Mantua. Friar Laurence promised to write to Romeo and explain the plan. The night before the wedding, Juliet took the drug and her family found her dead in the morning. The celebration turned into a funeral. Unfortunately, Romeo never received the letter from Friar Laurence. He returned to Verona where he found Juliet's body. He thought she was dead and was so devastated that he killed himself. When Juliet woke up and saw Romeo lying dead beside her, she killed herself too, with a dagger. As a result of the tragic series of events, the Capulets and the Montagues agreed to stop fighting and live in peace together.</h2><br />
